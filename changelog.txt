1.2.3 --MLA

* Added launchManual() method which allows you to force the autocomplete
  to appear without user interaction. Based on code from
  stackoverflow.com/questions/3624518/open-autocompleter-results-div-on-textbox-click

* Added refresh() method which reloads the autocomplete results. This is
  being used to modify/results the results based on other form elements.

* Added afterItemSelect callback option which is called when an item
  is selected from the autocomplete results. This is being used to set
  a separate hidden form element to keep track of a record ID behind
  the scenes.

1.2.2 --AGA
---
*Merged agmcleaod's fork: Added failure to the options hash: `failure`
*Merged borkor's fork: New option not to jump to first or last position: `scrollJumpPosition`
*Deleted silly console.debug() line left over from testing.

1.2.1 --AGA
---
*Added option to activate select list with one click instead of two. `clickFire` is false by default. (Requested/recommendation by fgosfacdjtq.)
* Added option to forgo input focus on item select. `inputFocus` is set to true by default, but setting it to false in the options will cancel this behavior.
* Circumvent browser JS bug when user clicked on results list scrollbar and then clicked outside of the list that caused the list to not hide.
* Changed hijacking of PAGEUP/PAGEDOWN keys to prevent default behavior only when selections list is visible. Helps text navigation inside input element.

1.2 --AGA
---
* Use recursive merging when extending setOptions. (Request/recommendation by smarques.)

1.1.1 --AGA
---
* Changed hijacking of UP/DOWN arrow keys to prevent default behavior only when selections list is visible. Helps text navigation inside input element.

1.1
---
* Added matchContains: "word" option, match only the start of words instead of everywhere
* Fixed mustMatch to trigger result event when no match was found
* Fixed the issue where an autocomplete was applied after the field had focus
* Extended multiple complete to enable editing words not at the end of the field (doesn't work in Opera)

1.0.2
-----
* Fixed missing semicolon

1.0.1
-----
* Fixed element creation (<ul> to <ul/> and <li> to </li>)
* Fixed ac_even class (was ac_event)
* Fixed bgiframe usage: now its really optional
* Removed the blur-on-return workaround, added a less obtrusive one only for Opera
* Fixed hold cursor keys: Opera needs keypress, everyone else keydown to scroll through result list when holding cursor key
* Updated package to jQuery 1.2.5, removing dimensions
* Fixed multiple-mustMatch: Remove only the last term when no match is found
* Fixed multiple without mustMatch: Don't select the last active when no match is found (on tab/return)
* Fixed multiple cursor position: Put cursor at end of input after selecting a value

1.0
